Description: Fast, lightweight text-to-speech engine
 Fast, lightweight Text-to-speech engine developed by Mycroft A.I.
 and VocaliD, based on Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s FLITE software.
 Mimic takes in text and reads it out loud to create a high quality voice.
 Mimic's low-latency, small resource footprint, and good quality voices set
 it apart from other open source text-to-speech projects.
